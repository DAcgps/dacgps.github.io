                Who is Alan Turing?
            </h1>
            <h2 class="infobox1">
                Alan Turing was born on June, 23rd, 1912 in London, England. He is considered the father of modern computer science as he was a brilliant mathematician and cryptographer.

                What did Alan Turing do?
            </h1>
            <h2 class="infobox1">
                One of Alan’s biggest accomplishments was that he worked as a codebreaker during World War II, cracking encrypted messages sent by the Nazi Germans. He worked to crack the Enigma cipher machine by developing a machine that can scan through code possibilities. In the end, Alan helped the allied forces’ victory in the war against Nazi Germany, possibly saving the lives of an estimated 2 million people.

            <h2 class="infobox1">
                Alan was born to parents Ethel Sara Stoney and Julius Mathison Turing and he had no siblings. Alan Turing went to the Sherborne School growing up. When Alan was young, he showed signs of great intelligence, but his teachers did not act upon it. He went off to attend King's College, which is now University of Cambridge from 1931-1934. Afterwards, he went to Princeton University in New Jersey to get his Ph.D in math and cryptology. When he was done, he took a part time position back in Cambridge to work as a cryptographer.

            <h2 class="infobox1">
                Alan Turing died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning. This was an act to take his own life as that would free him of a custodial sentence that he had gotten for his convitcion of being homosexual. The cyanide was determined to come from the apple or from the water on his bedside table. It is unknown which one is the source as the police did not do tests to determine.
